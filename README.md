<h1>Using Asp .Net MVC</h1>

<h4>
This project addresses the critical issue of hunger by creating an efficient system to rescue surplus food from restaurants and distribute it to those in need. 
The administrative aspect is managed by an admin with a fixed password, empowering them to add, edit, and delete employee details. Employees, in turn, play a pivotal
role in collecting surplus food and are granted access to view the available food items.

For restaurants, participation begins with a signup process, followed by the addition of surplus food details, including comprehensive lists and expiration dates. 
This streamlined approach not only minimizes food wastage but also maximizes the impact of rescuing and redistributing excess food to alleviate hunger. 
The collective efforts of admins, employees, and participating restaurants contribute to the overarching goal of making a meaningful difference in the battle against hunger.
